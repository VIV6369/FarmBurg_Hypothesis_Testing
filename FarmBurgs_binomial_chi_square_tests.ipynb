We’re not sure how much to charge for it, so we tested three different price points: 0.99 (group 'A'), 1.99 (group 'B'), and 4.99 (group 'C'). It looks like significantly more people bought the upgrade package for 0.99, so I guess that’s what we’ll charge.\n",

It’s true that more people wanted to purchase the upgrade at 0.99; you probably expected that. What we really want to know is whether *each price point* allows us to make enough money that we can *exceed* some *target goal*. Brian, how much do you think it cost to build this feature?\n",
